NC-News is a 2 weeks project created as part of the Northcoders Bootcamp. The aim is to create a news website that allows you to navigate through the different articles, topics and users and interact with them (logging in, posting comments or upvoting/downvoting...). This github project is the frontend part, created with React.JS.
Links to the backend and hosted version are available below.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

This project requires the node version v10.16.0  

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

### `npm test`

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
